# BlackjackGame 

## Rules
The objective of blackjack is commonly understood to get a hand as close to 21 as possible. In reality, the aim of the game is to beat the dealer's hand without going over 21. It's a small distinction but an important one, because sometimes players can win by staying on a hand that feels lower than ideal.

## Guide

-In this game player can hit the 'Hit' button to get as many cards as he likes until he gets a score(addup value of their cardvalue) less than 21, if the player crosses 21 then the player looses if the bot(computer) does not cross 21.

-After the player is satisfied with his score he can then hit the 'Stand' button next to the 'Hit' button, this will let the computer play its turn and gives some cards for the coumputer with its respective score.

-Then it decides wheather the player wins or the Bot(coumputer) wins according to the scores obtained.

-Everytime the player wins this will add up to the 'Win' coloum bellow, if the bot wins this will add up to the 'Lose' coloum and if the match is drawn this will add up to the 'Draw' section.

-Then hit the 'Deal' button to refresh and start the game again.
